# Coffee App

Customers are able to make a coffee order with customizations. Baristas are able to make an account, login, and complete orders as they show up. Baristas are able to delete orders and move them to a completed list. Orders completed by a logged in barista will have their name attached to the order.

## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

## Thoughts:

Pleasantly surprised how quick my team was able to complete this app - they're really smart! A few peers had already made a similar coffee page for their full stack logins, so we were able to pull from there and add extra features to make this more POS.
